# Making Your Own ConnectBox

The easiest way to build a ConnectBox is to simply download a prepared image of the ConnectBox software for the flavor of your device (*NanoPi NEO* or *RPi*), burn that image to a uSD card, put the card in your device, add an antenna and power up. There are currently both NEO ([v20201007a](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/releases/tag/v20201007a)) and RPi (*need link*) versions available on this website. If you have an interest in compiling your own image, see the document *making_an_image.md* document ([Making an Image](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/blob/master/docs/making_an_image.md)) for detailed instructions. 

# Building a ConnectBox image

The *making_an_image.md* document (see [Making an Image](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/blob/master/docs/making_an_image.md)) is a detailed update of the process used to build an image from the source codes residing on GitHub/ConnectBox. It covers all aspects of the task from describing an overview of the process, to step by step instructions for creation of the *workstation* (both Mac and RPi flavors), and building both NEO and RPi images of the ConnectBox. 

# Connectbox setup and administration

The *administration.md* and *administration_rpi.md* documents (see [Administration Docs](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/blob/master/docs/administration.md) and [Administration Docs for RPi](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/blob/master/docs/administration_rpi.md)) are the source documents for the *README.txt* default media content deployed on the NEO and RPi based ConnectBoxes.

# Developing the ConnectBox Software

The *development.md* document (see [Development Docs](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/blob/master/docs/development.md)) gives good guidelines on the tools and methodology used in developing and enhancing the software used on the ConnectBox.

# Deploying the ConnnectBox Software

The *deployment.md* document (see [Deployment Docs](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/blob/master/docs/deployment.md)) was the original document describing the development process and tools used in creating and deploying the ConnectBox software.
